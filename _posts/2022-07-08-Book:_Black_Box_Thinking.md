# My learnings from the book: "Black Box Thinking" by Matthew Syed

This book is about decision making and learning in complex circumstances.

My learnings from this book are the following:
1. Effective learning from mistakes is essential: Accepting failure is hard (self-justification mechanisms). We need institutions to identify and learn from mistakes
2. Good systems to track failures are essential: Instant feedback; clear goals; considering different kinds of data (e.g. "winners curse"); open culture;
3. The world and most systems are too complex to understand: Philip Tetlock Study;
4. Cognitive Biases (Dissonances) that impede learning from mistakes: Disposition effect (e.g. loosing money is much more painful than winning money is nice); Cognitive Dissonance (we donÂ´t like information that challenges our believes and will try to resolve those by producing a story); Our memory is not very precis; Confirmation bias (we always try to confirm our hypothesis
6. Testing and adapting: Produce a "minimum viable product" and test/ adopt it again and again (accounts for unintended consequences and complexity); Use randomise control trials;
